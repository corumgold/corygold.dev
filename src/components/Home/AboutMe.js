      <p>
        Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I started becoming interested in web
        development when cobbled together my first website using WordPress back
        in 2015. Since then, I have spent countless hours learning everything I
        can about front end to back end development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have self taught and been formally trained in several different
        technologies including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6)</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Express.js</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutMe;
