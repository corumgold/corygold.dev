      <p>
        Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I started becoming interested in web
        development when cobbled together my first website using WordPress back
        in 2015. I knew a little bit of HTML and CSS, how much more could there
        be?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I have spent countless hours learning everything I can about
        front end to back end development. What I love so much about development
        is the process - whether it be figuring out how to pass test specs or 
        creating an application from the ground up, there's always something more to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have taught myself and been formally trained in several different
        technologies including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Express.js</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutMe;
